# PMM-quickstart
quickstart script for building a basic config for PMM

1. create a python3 venv
2. `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. run with `python config-gen.py`
4. Follow the prompts.

If you're doing a lot of this, copy `config.json.default` to `config.json` and fill in the values.  The script will read those and then you can just hit return to accept the defaults.
